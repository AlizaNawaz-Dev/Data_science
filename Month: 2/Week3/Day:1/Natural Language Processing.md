# Natural Language Processing (NLP):
- Giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings do.  
- NLP makes it possible for computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important.   
- The goal of NLP is to allow non-programmers to obtain useful information from computing systems using natural languages that they speak.  

- Natural language processing includes many different techniques for interpreting human language.
