# Natural Language Processing (NLP):
- Giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings do.  
- NLP makes it possible for computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important.   
- The goal of NLP is to allow non-programmers to obtain useful information from computing systems using natural languages that they speak.  
- Natural language processing includes many different techniques for interpreting human language.

- There are two main components of NLP  

### 1- Natural Language Understading (NLU):  

   ○ Mapping the given input in natural language into useful representation.  
   
### 2- Natural Language Generator (NLG):  

   ○ Producing meaningful phrases and sentences in the form of natural language.  
   
## Challenges in NLU(understading):  
**1- Lexical ambiguty**

•During NLU phase input speech is divided into multiple tokens(parts) and it is difficult or impossible to understand it without some additional information.  

**2- Syntactic ambiguty** 

•Represents sentences that can be parsed in multiple syntactical(according to syntax) forms.  

**3- Symantic ambiguty**

•When the meaning of the words themselves can be misinterpreted.  

**4- Pragmetic ambiguty**  

• where the context of a phrase gives  multiple interpretations(when the statement is not specific).
