# Tables:
- In relational database tabels are used to store information where **information is stored in rows and columns**.

- Each row represents a **group of related data values**(all present information of a single entity).  

- A column describes a **field of information** all entities possess(Single peice of information about one entity).  

# Keys:
- Used to **establish and identify** relationships between tables and within a table.

- There are multiple keys in relational DB having different roles.  

 ⇒ **Primary key:**
 
 •  It's a **unique** identifier.
 
 •  Any column containing **unique attributes** can be assigned as primary key.  
 
 • **For Example:**   
               ∙ In DB of citizen's **CNIC of every person is unique** so we can identify each citizen uniquely using their cnic.   
               
               ∙ There's a possibility of having multiple citizens of same name so here primary key come in action and identify each person as seperate entity based on CNIC. 
               
⇒ **Foreign key:**  

• Provides a **link** between data in two tables.  

• It's basically a column or a set of columns in a table whose **values correspond to the values of the primary key** in another table.   

• In simple words foreign key is primary key of another table.  

⇒ **Composite key:** 

• A primary key having **two or more attributes**.   

• If a single column can't identify any row uniquely, a **combination of over one column** can uniquely identify any record.
