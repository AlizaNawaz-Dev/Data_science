# Database Design:
- Databse design is categorized into **two** main parts.  

➥ **Logical Design:**
- Logical design is more **conceptual and abstract**.   
- Or we can say designing **general layout**(like casually on paper) to get an idea of what we want.   
- To define the data **elements**and their **relationships**.  

➥ **Physical Design:**  
- To design the actual database based on the requirements gathered during the **logical data design.**  

- **DBA:**    
 ✦ who directs and performs all activities related to maintaining a successful database environment.
 
- Database administrator (DBA)**implements** the design.
