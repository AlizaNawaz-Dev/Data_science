# Combinatorics  
Counting the number of ways to put things together into various combinations.  
It includes the enumeration or counting of objects having certain properties. 
To search for a suitable combinatorial construct that does fit the data.
### Use in Data Science  
- Graph Theory:Study of objects and connections between them.
- Algorithms and Data Structures: For analysis and design, efficiently store and retrieve data. 
- Discrete Optimization : problems which are too hard for mechanistic procedures.  
- Computational Geometry.
