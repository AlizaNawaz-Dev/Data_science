# Basics of probability for data science
## Probability:  
It is the **chance** an event will happen. It's basically the ratio of the number of ways an event can occur to the number of **possible outcomes**.  
  
```Probability = No. of ways certain event can occur / No. of possible events```  
Notionally:

***P (A) = n/N   = n (A)/n(S)***         
### Probability in daily life:
•	When we toss a coin. The result of this means the coin can either land on the ‘heads’ side or ‘tails’.  
•	Rolling of die.  
•	Choosing a card from deck.  
•	Winning a lucky draw.  
•	There is a high chance of getting the job this year.
